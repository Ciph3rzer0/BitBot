<title>BOT Fire</title>
<text>Now that you have learned how to move your BOT, you will want to learn how to defend yourself upon running into enemies.
The basic offensive skill that your BOT knows is to fire. You will learn how to make your BOT fire its rounds as you are moving.

As you are firing at enemies, you will want your BOT's gun to rotate also. You will also learn how to rotate your BOT's turret in this tutorial.

The two functions you will need are:
Firing a Bullet:
	call bot_fire()

Rotating the BOT's turret:
	call bot_turn(int angle)  - where angle is the degree of rotation the turret will rotate.

These functions are very simple, and will be very useful in writing your BOT's code before sending it out into different missions.

<hint>
Goal: While Moving your BOT, continuously rotate its turret and Fire its gun with every move.

Move your BOT in a similar manner as where you completed the Movement tutorial:

while 1 do
	call bot_move(45, 5)
loop

Add in the additional functions you will need to make your BOT turn its turret and fire.

Two functions you will need:
call bot_fire()
call bot_turn(int angle) where angle will be a a variable that changes by 1 with each iteration through the while loop.

This will look something like this:
let a = 5
while ...
	...
	call bot_turn(a)
	...
	let a = a + 1
loop
</hint>
<answer>let a = 5
while 1 do
	call bot_move(45, 5)
	call bot_turn(a)
	call bot_fire()
	let a = a + 1
loop
</answer>
