<title>Selection Statements</title>
<text>
There is only one selection type statement available to you in the BotBasic Language.
This statement is the If Statement.

In computer science, conditional statements, conditional expressions and conditional constructs are features of a programming language which perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified boolean condition evaluates to true or false. Apart from the case of branch predication, this is always achieved by selectively altering the control flow based on some condition.

The BotBasic if statement looks like:

if &lt;expr&gt; then
	&lt;list of commands&gt;
endif

<hint>
Goal: Create an if statement that executes the internal commands.

The 'If Statement' is used to execute a list of commands if the expression is true.
	
The syntax of this command is:

If [expr] then
    [list of commands]
endif

Create an if statement that tests whether a variable i is equal to 5.
Then executes a command that prints out the string "expression was true"

Your Code should look like this:
1. Let i = 5
2: If i = 5 then
	print "expression was true"
   endif
</hint>
<answer>Let i = 5
if i = 5 then
	print "expression was true"
endif</answer>
