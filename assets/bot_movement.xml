<title>Bot Movements</title>
<text>
In order to become familiar with the BotBasic language, you will need to learn the BOTS event driven methods,
along with the actions it can perform. In this tutorial you will learn how to move your bot around for simple navigation.
These techniques will come in handy when writing your programs that you will attach to your BOT upon sending it into the Missions.

The syntax of the move commmand you will learn in this tutorial is:

bot_move(int angle, int speed)

where the angle is the angle in which the bot will move at, and the speed is how fast it will move.

<hint>Goal: Move your BOT using the built in move commands.

In order to move your BOT you will need to call the function bot_move(int angle, int speed)

To make it continuously move, it is recommended to put this call inside a while loop.

Your Code should look something like this:

while 1 do
	call bot_move(45, 5)
loop
